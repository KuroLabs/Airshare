<h4 align="center">Cross-platform content sharing in a local network.</h4>

<p align="justify"><b>Airshare</b> is a Python-based CLI tool and module that lets you transfer data between two machines in a local network, P2P, using Multicast-DNS. It also opens an HTTP gateway for other non-CLI external interfaces. It works completely offline! Built with aiohttp and zeroconf. Checkout the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJH6bkLRdSw">demo</a>.</p>

## Features

* Blazing fast content transfer within a local network.

* Lets you transfer plain text, send from or receive into your clipboard.

* Supports transfer of multiple files, directories and large files - content is sent chunk by chunk and never read into memory entirely.

* Lets you send files whose paths have been copied into the clipboard (more details in the docs).

* Cross-platform, works on Linux, Windows and Mac (CLI and Web Interface), and also supports mobile (Web Interface).

* Uses Multicast-DNS service registration and discovery - so you can access content with human-readable code words.

* Can be used as a module in other Python programs.

## Installation

### [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)

```bash
$ pip install Airshare
```

### [pipx](https://pipxproject.github.io/pipx/)

```bash
$ pipx install Airshare
```

### [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)

```bash
$ brew install airshare
```

If you have a non-Apple device, consider installing Avahi (for Linux) or Bonjour (for Windows) if you'd like to use Link-local Name Resolution (for the `.local` addresses).

## Example

Send and receive files and directories.

To send using the CLI,

```bash
$ airshare noobmaster requirements.txt
```
To receive using the CLI,

```bash
$ airshare noobmaster
```

or visit `http://noobmaster.local` in the browser to download.

You can also `import airshare` in any Python program. Visit the documentation for detailed usage instructions.

## Known Issues

* Link-local Name Resolution (for the `.local` addresses) on non-Apple devices requires Avahi (on Linux) or Bonjour (on Windows). Chances are you already have them, but if you don't, do check the web on how to install them.

* Link-local Name Resolution does not work on Android phones. This is because Android browsers do not have inbuilt Multicast-DNS service discovery. For this reason, we included QR Code support, for you to visit the URLs easily.

* Windows users with Python < 3.8, use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Break</kbd> to quit, as <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> will not work. This is a known issue with `asyncio`, which has been fixed in Python 3.8. If you do not have a <kbd>Break</kbd> key, try using <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Fn</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd>, or check the web for other alternatives (depending on your PC).
